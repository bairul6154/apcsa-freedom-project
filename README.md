# APCSA Freedom Project
by Bairu Li

## Context
Freedom Project is just as the name sounds. Each APCSA student will choose a topic that they are going to create through a form of programming.
Either working individually or with a partner, they will document their steps and processes in these blog entries.

## Content
My project is going to be about bonding shapes. For my final project in AP Chemistry, I made a game revolving around bond geometries; for example, trigonal planar,
tetrahedra, and t-shape. I used a javascript library called p5js which is mostly designed for 2D. To improve on my bonding game, I will use a 3D engine
to improve clarity and as well as changing it into a simulator instead.
