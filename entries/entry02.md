### Process
I have tinkered with *Babylon.js* and I have decided that I would use this tool.
I copied the template of the code from the official site. Since there are some CSS and HTML aside from JS, I deleted some code and tested some individually to see what they do.
Moreover, I tinkered with numbers of some basic shapes such as boxes, spheres, and cylinders to see what they do. Also I messed around with the lighting and the camera.

I have found that there are a lot to learn in Babylon and as well as many extentions that could offer lot more possibility.
Babylon allows **interactivity** and custom shapes. I am confident that this tool can be used to create my chemistry game/simulator.

I followed some tutorials about how to use Babylon. Links to them below.
