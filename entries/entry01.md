I decided to remake my final AP Chemistry project from last year. I feel like I can make definetly improve on that project since I am still not satisfied with the result.
The tool that I decided to try out is a javascript library called babylon.js. I chose this tool over unity and other 3D engines because I want this project to be
easily accessable wihtout the need to download it on your device. Of course you would need wifi but it won't require you to download.
